Hey! 👋  
This is my submission for the **Credora React Internship Task**. I’ve built a simple but modern React application to manage student profiles where users can easily add, view, and delete student records.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **Add Students**  
  A simple form to enter a student’s name, email, and course.

- **Student Gallery**  
  All student profiles are displayed in a clean and readable card layout.

- **Easy Cleanup**  
  Each student card includes a delete button to remove records instantly.

- **Clean & Modern UI**  
  The interface is kept minimal and professional to ensure clarity and usability.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The application works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
